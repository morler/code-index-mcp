## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Content Validation for Edit Operations
The system SHALL provide robust content validation for file edit operations with proper whitespace handling and accurate partial matching.

#### Scenario: Exact content match with normalized whitespace
- **WHEN** old_content matches current file content ignoring trailing whitespace
- **THEN** edit operation proceeds without stripping internal formatting

#### Scenario: Partial content match with precise replacement
- **WHEN** old_content is found within current file content
- **THEN** system replaces only exact matches, preserving unrelated lines

#### Scenario: Improved deletion operation
- **WHEN** new_content is empty and old_content matches multiple lines
- **THEN** system removes only lines containing exact old_content matches

#### Scenario: Clear mismatch error messages
- **WHEN** no suitable match is found for old_content
- **THEN** system returns specific error with content length and first 50 characters
