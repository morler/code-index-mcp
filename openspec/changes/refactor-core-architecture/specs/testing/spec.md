## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Focused Test Suite
The system SHALL maintain a minimal, focused test suite.

#### Scenario: Test consolidation
- **WHEN** running test suite
- **THEN** maximum 5 core test files exist
- **AND** no duplicate test scenarios

#### Scenario: Test coverage
- **WHEN** measuring coverage
- **THEN** maintain >80% code coverage
- **AND** focus on critical paths only

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Comprehensive Test Matrix
**Reason**: 40+ test files create maintenance burden with diminishing returns
**Migration**: Consolidate into 5 focused test files covering core functionality

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Performance Baseline Testing
The system SHALL include performance regression tests.

#### Scenario: Baseline comparison
- **WHEN** running performance tests
- **THEN** compare against established baseline metrics
- **AND** fail on significant performance degradation

#### Scenario: Memory usage validation
- **WHEN** processing large codebases
- **THEN** memory usage stays within defined limits
- **AND** automatic cleanup occurs at thresholds
