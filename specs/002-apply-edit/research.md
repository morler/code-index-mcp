# Research Document: Apply Edit Backup Removal

## Memory-based Backup Strategy

**Decision**: Implement in-memory backup using file content caching instead of disk-based backup files.

**Rationale**: 
- Eliminates disk I/O overhead for backup creation/deletion
- Provides faster rollback capability through direct memory restoration
- Reduces disk space usage significantly
- Simplifies error handling logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Disk-based backup with configurable location (rejected: adds complexity)
- No backup with atomic file operations (rejected: risk of data corruption)
- Database-backed file state (rejected: over-engineering for simple use case)

## File Locking Mechanism

**Decision**: Use OS-level file locking (fcntl on Unix, LockFileEx on Windows) for concurrent edit protection.

**Rationale**:
- Provides reliable cross-process synchronization
- Built-in OS support, no additional dependencies
- Automatic cleanup on process termination
- Well-established pattern for file editing tools

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom lock files with PID tracking (rejected: race conditions possible)
- In-memory locking only (rejected: doesn't work across processes)
- Database transaction locks (rejected: overkill for file operations)

## Memory Management Strategy

**Decision**: Implement LRU cache with configurable memory limit (default 50MB for file backups).

**Rationale**:
- Prevents memory exhaustion with large files
- Automatically evicts old backups when memory limit reached
- Provides predictable memory usage patterns
- Integrates with existing caching infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unlimited memory usage (rejected: risk of OOM)
- Fixed-size buffer per file (rejected: inefficient for small files)
- Temporary disk spillage (rejected: re-introduces disk I/O complexity)

## Error Handling and Rollback

**Decision**: Use try-catch blocks with automatic content restoration on any exception.

**Rationale**:
- Guarantees file integrity regardless of error type
- Simple and reliable pattern
- Works with both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- No complex state machine required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Transaction logs (rejected: over-engineering)
- Checkpoint/restore system (rejected: adds unnecessary complexity)
- Best-effort recovery (rejected: doesn't guarantee data integrity)

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Implement lazy loading and early termination strategies.

**Rationale**:
- Only read file content when actually needed for backup
- Cancel operations early if memory limits would be exceeded
- Use streaming for large file operations when possible
- Minimize memory allocations during edit operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Eager loading of all file content (rejected: memory inefficient)
- Full file buffering regardless of size (rejected: doesn't scale)
- No optimization (rejected: doesn't meet performance goals)

## Integration with Existing Codebase

**Decision**: Modify existing BackupManager class to use memory-based approach while maintaining API compatibility.

**Rationale**:
- Minimal code changes required
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces
- Leverages existing error handling patterns
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete rewrite of edit system (rejected: high risk, unnecessary)
- New parallel edit system (rejected: code duplication)
- Plugin-based architecture (rejected: over-engineering)
